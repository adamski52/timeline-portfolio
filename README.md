# Portfolio 2017 (currently in development)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.2.

## Running the project

Run `npm install` if this is your first time running the project.  After installation is complete, run `npm start`.  The front end will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`. The (mock) backend will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.  Coverage can be viewed at `http://localhost:4200/coverage` after running `npm test`.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Permissions/tokens
You will not be able to obtain real data without my auth token (which I'm not giving out of course).  To view data, set an environment variable named `API_USE_MOCK` and re-run the project.  The data loaded will be served from the `/mocks` folder.  It is real data - it's just not live data.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).  This will also generate code coverage which can be viewed at `http://localhost:4200/coverage` (note: the server must be running in order to host these files.  use `npm start` to run it.)

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
